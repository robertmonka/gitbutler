# GitButler Agent Instructions

GitButler is a Rust/Svelte/React/TypeScript monorepo.

Apply all relevant instruction files. If instructions conflict, resolve them in
this order:

1. Explicit human instructions
2. Nearest nested `AGENTS.md`
3. This file

## Repo Map

- `crates/` - Rust crates.
- `apps/desktop/` - Tauri/Svelte desktop app.
- `apps/web/` - Svelte web app.
- `apps/lite/` - Electron/React desktop app.
- `packages/` - shared TypeScript packages, including the SDK.
- `e2e/` - Playwright, WebdriverIO, and blackbox end-to-end tests.

## Working Style

- Treat questions about the codebase as read-only unless the user asks for changes.
- Make focused, reviewable changes; avoid unrelated rewrites.
- Use the simplest design that solves the actual problem; do not add
  speculative machinery, and remove machinery your change makes unnecessary.
- Inspect nearby code before introducing patterns.
- Prefer existing APIs, tests, and conventions.
- Before declaring shared behavior done, check each applicable surface and contract
  (desktop, web, Lite, CLI/TUI, N-API, SDK, and docs) and update it or explicitly
  determine that it is unaffected.
- Run targeted validation for the area touched.
- Before adding new machinery to fix a behavior bug, reproduce the bug in a failing
  test and survey the target file's existing loops and classifications as candidate
  hosts; let the tests, not the diagnosis, set how much implementation the fix needs.
- When a fix calls for a new mechanism (a new module, a new public API, or a parallel
  walk where one already exists), propose the intended shape before building it.

## Scoped Instructions

- For Rust work under `crates/`, follow `crates/AGENTS.md`.
- For Lite work under `apps/lite/`, follow `apps/lite/AGENTS.md`.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
